I am a full-time University Student, majoring in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I was born and raised in a small city named [Kathmandu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu), [Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal) and moved to the [United States of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) in 2009. I, sometimes work as a freelancer during my free time where I design and develop Android Applications, Web Applications, Windows applications and small scripts. I work on my personal projects as well, in order to build a proper resume to display my knowledge and experience in the development field, I believe it to be equally important as my G.P.A.
