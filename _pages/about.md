I am a full-time University Student, majoring in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I, sometimes work as a freelancer during my free time where I design and develop Android Applications, Web Applications, Windows applications and small scripts. I work on various [**personal projects**](/projects) as well. I mostly code in JavaScript, more focused on [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) but I can extend my skills to various system software development languages such as [C#](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)>), [Java](https://www.java.com/), and [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/). For script development, I prefer [Bash](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bash_Shell_Scripting) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).
