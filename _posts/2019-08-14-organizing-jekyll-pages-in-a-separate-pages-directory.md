I noticed an increase in pages inside my Jekyll websiteâ€™s root directory. It adds up, eventually. To organize my pages that existed in the root directory, I found a way to arrange all the pages in a separate `_pages` directory or any directory with the name of your choice.

This is what my old Jekyll blog repository looked like, the repository's files and directories layout.

As we can notice **6** `.md` files _(pages)_ in our project's root directory. The more pages you require, the more files you create in your root directory, hence, the search for a perfect solution to keep our project organized.

### Solution

The solution to organizing the pages in our Jekyll blog's file structure is to **create a new directory**, I preferred `_pages` because it relates to the other directories such as `_posts`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, etc. It does not necessarily need to be named `_pages`, it can be anything, I mean, anything!

Move all `*.md` files in your root directory to `_pages` or the newly created pages directory except for the `index.md` because that is our access point _(in a way)_.

Head over to `_config.yml` file and append the following code to instruct the Jekyll build to include all files in `_pages` or directory we recently created.

{% highlight yml %}
include: ["_pages"]
{% endhighlight %}

... and that's it. Rebuild your blog, and everything should be running as excepted, and we now have a clean and organized Jekyll file structure.
