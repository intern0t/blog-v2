What my **Project FileSec** did can be done straight from terminal which is quite nice to hear but CLI isn\'t for everyone, honestly respect their preference however. I am currently using [Ubuntu 17.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/17.04/) as my main work-space therefore **OpenSSL** is available through official repository.

Install it using `sudo apt install openssl`.

The commands are pretty straightforward for `OpenSSL` which can also be reviewed using `man openssl` in your terminal. Basically, in order to simply encrypt or decrypt a file, we can make use of `-e` or `-d` parameters. Couple examples to easily understand what I am trying to say is shown below.

First, let us create a file which holds secret text/string/data and what not.

{% highlight bash %}
echo 'This is my secret string.' >> secret.txt
{% endhighlight %}

Verify whether the `secret.txt` file was created and the string was successfully appended to our secret file. Once verified, run `openssl aes-256-cbc -e -in secret.txt -out secret.txt.enc` in your terminal where you created your `secret.txt` file.
<!--excerpt-->
Once the encryption command using AES 256 CBC is executed and completed, you should see an output file with the same name as `secret.txt` but `.enc` in the end. The reason I do this is to keep track of file extensions during the encryption, once again, personal preference! `-out <output_file_name>`, hence you can set the output filename to whatever you want. For small files like `secret.txt`, we don't necessarily need to use `aes-256-cbc` as `aes-128-cbc` works faster `openssl aes-128-cbc -e -in secret.txt -out secret.txt.enc`.

You can test their performance and completion timing yourself using `time` command in front of your main encryption/decryption commands.

{% highlight bash %}
time openssl aes-128-cbc -e -in secret.txt -out secret.txt.enc -pass pass:prashantme
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
time openssl aes-256-cbc -e -in secret.txt -out secret.txt.enc -pass pass:prashantme
{% endhighlight %}

Comparison AES-256-CBC vs. AES-128-CBC `0.001 second` and -`9 seconds` difference on `AES-256-CBC` compared to `AES-128-CBC`. I would still go with `256` Bits just because of the `3n` layer encryption.

#### Python Script

So yeah, yet another tiny Python script to make my life easier. I definitely have couple ideas running in my mind for this particular script, let us see what happens in the future. What this script does is simplifies this complex `openssl` command into short and sweet command. If we take above codes as an example, `openssl aes-256-cbc -e -in secret.txt -out secret.txt.enc -pass pass:prashantme` becomes `FileSec.py -e/-d secret.txt/secret.txt.enc prashantme`. Simple, isn't it?

You can create a Symlink for this file which allows the user to run `FileSec.py` from anywhere. First of all, allow the `.py` file execution permission using `sudo chmod +x FileSec.py`. Creating Symlink is very easy, head over to `/usr/local/bin` and type this command in your terminal.

{% highlight bash %}
ln -s /Path/to/FileSec.py .
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can call and encrypt your files from wherever you want.

## Using FileSec.py

I tried my best to write this script to make my life/work easier, without all key file, cipher, IV keys and such. Instead, I had a mindset of how big of a file will I be encrypting, the consistency of encryption and how often will I be encrypting/decrypting my files. Using `FileSec.py` is as simple as I could write.

{% highlight bash %}
FileSec.py -e secret.txt key
FileSec.py -d secret.txt.enc key
{% endhighlight %}

It uses 256 bits and `cbc` encryption by default which you can change if you prefer 128. I knowingly decided **not** to remove the original copy of the file, things could go south in an instant but this way, the user can check and verify and remove the original copy if necessary.
