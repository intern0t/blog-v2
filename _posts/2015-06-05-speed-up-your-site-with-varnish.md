[Varnish Cache](https://www.varnish-cache.org/) is a module which I believe is specifically developed for TEXT/HTML based hosting systems which enhances the performance of the hosted website significantly from either your RAM or the hard drive. According to **[Varnish Administrator Document](https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/4.0/)** ..

> Varnish Cache is a web application accelerator also known as a caching HTTP reverse proxy. You install it in front of any server that speaks HTTP and configure it to cache the contents. Varnish Cache is really, really fast. It typically speeds up delivery with a factor of 300 - 1000x, depending on your architecture.
<!--excerpt-->
Varnish Cache is **very** easy to install and configure if you have a default web hosting setup. If you have a messy setup like mine, you **might** experience some confusion during the configuration process. I am currently using CentOS Web-panel which I am loving it so far which is using Apache and I haven't moved to Nginx yet, not for this server at least. For me personally, the biggest problem was understanding how Varnish works and making correct configuration for it to work with **all** the domains hosted in this server. Not only that, I've to worry about keeping this [blog](http://www.nepirates.com/) running.

> I understand, not everyone uses [CWP](http://centos-webpanel.com/) so I will try my best to provide the alternative ways to accomplish the same result.

Even after using Cloudflare's CDN, I couldn't **perceive** the performance of the website. Cloudflare's CDN redirects the visitor to the nearest server to their location and from there on, it's **none** of my business. As long as the my visitors reach my site and be able to surf *without* any problems, I do not care about how many **merry-go-rounds** the packets does before reaching the visitors from my server and vice-versa. Definitely, I do not want to title myself as *Captain Obvious* but more the merry-go-rounds, more the **latency** and I for one do not favor latency.

I've [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) [**installed**](http://www.nepirates.com/successfully-installed-ghost/), as a blogging platform so it isn't easy to manage this platform, definitely better than most of the blogging platforms out there though. 

There are the confirmations I made using Varnish cache in various situations.

{% endhighlight %}

Lets start off by firing our terminal and adding Varnish cache to our server's packet manager and installing Varnish.

{% highlight bash %}
rpm --nosignature -i https://repo.varnish-cache.org/redhat/varnish-4.0.el6.rpm
yum install varnish
{% endhighlight %}

For me, before I installed Varnish, it was `Apache to Ghost` with reverse proxy from port `80` to Ghost's port `2368`.

I changed the Apache port to Varnish recommended port `82` in `vhosts.conf` which is located in `/usr/local/apache/conf.d/`.

[![Image](https://i.imgur.com/07jpXLJ.png)](https://i.imgur.com/07jpXLJ.png "Changing port."){:data-rel="lightcase"}

After changing the listening port to `82`, restart `httpd` for your server to start listening on port `82` for your site. Try `yourdomain.com:82`.

If you want to deploy Varnish to all the domains that you **might** or **will** host in the same server in the future, it is better to set web protocol to port `82` as a whole.

Now that our server is using port `82` to listen to web traffic, you need to change so that Varnish listens to port `80` in `/etc/sysconfig/varnish`.

You need to change `VARNISH_LISTEN_PORT` using any text editor you prefer, I used `nano` therefore

{% highlight bash %}
nano /etc/sysconfig/varnish
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight php %}
# # Default address and port to bind to
# # Blank address means all IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces, otherwise specify
# # a host name, an IPv4 dotted quad, or an IPv6 address in brackets.
# VARNISH_LISTEN_ADDRESS=
VARNISH_LISTEN_PORT=80
{% endhighlight %}

In the same file, you have the option to set whether you want Varnish to store the cache in the server **RAM** or in your **disk**. If you want to store the cache in your **disk**, change `VARNISH_STORAGE` to `file` **and/or** `malloc` to store the cache in your RAM. You need to make sure that you have an **adequate** amount of RAM.

{% highlight bash %}
# Store the cache in your disk!
# # Backend storage specification
VARNISH_STORAGE="file,/var/lib/varnish/varnish_storage.bin,${VARNISH_STORAGE_SIZE}"
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
# Store the cache in your RAM!
# # Backend storage specification
VARNISH_STORAGE="malloc,${VARNISH_STORAGE_SIZE}"
{% endhighlight %}

The disk storage of cache is superb if you have a SSD. I run on 512 MB RAM for the server that I am using to host this blog and many other websites, the RAM isn't adequate at all therefore, using disk cache for my server is working perfectly! I've **5 GB** of SSD available for this server so I set Varnish cache size allocation to **1 GB**.

That is all I did to make Varnish Cache working in my server. Finally you can test it through a nifty website named [Is Varnish Working?](http://www.isvarnishworking.com/) brought to you by [Cadre](https://www.getcadre.com/). Here's my [Is Varnish Working?](http://www.isvarnishworking.com/) result.
